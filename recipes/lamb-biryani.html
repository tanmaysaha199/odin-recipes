        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Biryani is a bit of a project and is time-consuming, but I have never been disappointed with the results. 
            Since it is such a festive dish, I usually make it for dinner parties. It is a huge hit.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups basmati rice</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>

            <li>1 pound lamb chops</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>4 green chile peppers, halved lengthwise</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground red pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>7½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li> 
            <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon saffron</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons warm milk</li>  
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in the hot 
                oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
                 Stir the garlic paste and ginger paste into the onion mixture; cook until the garlic and ginger is fragrant, about 1 
                 minute more. Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the mixture and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the mixture; continue cooking until the oil begins 
                to separate from the gravy, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, 
                about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry.</li>
            <li>Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little 
                chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; fry the sliced onion in the hot oil until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice. Spread the fried 
                onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over 
                the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, 
                about 15 minutes.</li>            
        </ol>
