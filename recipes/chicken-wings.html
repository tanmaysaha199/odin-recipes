        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Buffalo wing in American cuisine is an unbreaded chicken wing section (flat or drumette) that is generally deep-fried and 
            then coated or dipped in a sauce consisting of a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and melted butter prior to serving.            
            They are traditionally served hot, along with celery sticks and carrot sticks with blue cheese dressing or, primarily outside
            of New York, ranch dressing for dipping. Buffalo wings are often called simply "wings" or "chicken wings".

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup yellow mustard</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>5 pounds chicken wings, cut into thirds and tips discarded</li>            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix brown sugar, mustard, and soy sauce together in a bowl. Measure 1/4 cup marinade for basting and transfer to a small bowl; 
                cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Place wings in a large resealable bag. Pour remaining marinade over wings, coating well. Seal and marinate wings at least 2 
                hours and up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken wings from resealable bag and transfer to a baking sheet. Discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Baste wings with reserved 1/4 cup marinade; cook, basting every 10 minutes, until 
                chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 more minutes.</li>
            <li></li>
