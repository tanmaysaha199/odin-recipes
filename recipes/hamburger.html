        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are juicy, and spices can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. 
            Baste frequently with your favorite barbeque sauce. If you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread 
            crumbs until it forms patties that hold their shape.</p>
